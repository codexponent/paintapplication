# Paint Application
--------

We all can paint using all the drawing tools but what about drawing from the commands. If you want that then this is the app for you. The Paint Application takes command in the form of file, then parses it with the code and then draws it on the application.<br />
Paint Application is a Java Based Application. The whole drawing is done on Swing framework.<br />
A Real Production Application can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. Everybody is welcome!!<br /> <br />
